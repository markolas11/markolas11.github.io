<p>I'm a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://labs.bio.cmu.edu/yttri/" target="_blank">Yttri Lab</a> in the Department of Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests are centered on how the brain makes decisions and how those decisions can be executed via movement.</p> 
<p>I have previously trained with <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/principal-investigators/elisabeth-murray" target="_blank">Dr. Betsy Murray</a> at the National Institute of Mental Health studying cortical and subcortical contributions to learning, value and decision making. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience where I trained with Dr. Sandra Kuhlman (<a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=skuhlman" target="_blank">current faculty at University of Buffalo</a>) studying functional plasticity in the visual cortex.</p>
<p>I am passionate about scientific education and outreach. Both in lab and in the classroom I try to get students to master the material by learning to solve the problem at hand. Since 2022, I have been the course instructor for Advanced Systems Neuroscience at Carnegie Mellon.</p>
<p>As a senior graduate student in the lab, I am looking to graduate soon and am interested to continue in my postdoctoral studies using a systems neuroscience approach to explore learning and value-based decision making.</p>
<p>Outside of science I enjoy cooking, watching and playing soccer and playing with my dog <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="openRandomImage();" title="Click for a random image of Woody!">Woody</a>.</p>
