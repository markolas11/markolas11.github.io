<p>I'm a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://labs.bio.cmu.edu/yttri/" target="_blank">Yttri Lab</a> in the Department of Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University.<br>


My research interests are centered on how the brain makes decisions and how those decisions are executed via movement.<br>

I have previously trained with Dr. Betsy Murray at the National Institute of Mental Health studying cortical and subcortical contributions to learning, value and decision making. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a degree in Neuroscience where I trained with Dr. Sandra Kuhlman studying functional plasticity in the visual cortex.<br>
