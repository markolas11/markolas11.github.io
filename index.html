<p> hello world padding </p>
<p>I'm a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://labs.bio.cmu.edu/yttri/" target="_blank">Yttri Lab</a> in the Department of Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests are centered on how the brain makes decisions and how those decisions are executed via movement.</p> 
I have previously trained with <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/principal-investigators/elisabeth-murray" target="_blank">Dr. Betsy Murray</a> at the National Institute of Mental Health studying cortical and subcortical contributions to learning, value and decision making. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Bachelor's degree in Neuroscience where I trained with <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/bio/people/faculty/kuhlman.html" target="_blank">Dr. Sandra Kuhlman</a> studying functional plasticity in the visual cortex.</p>
<p>I am passionate about scientific education and outreach. Both in lab and in the classroom I try to get students to master the material by learning to solve the problem at hand. Most recently I was the course instructor for Advanced Systems Neuroscience at Carnegie Mellon.</p>

<p>Outside of science I enjoy cooking, watching and playing soccer and playing with my dog Woody.</p>
