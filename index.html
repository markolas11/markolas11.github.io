I'm a PhD candidate in the Yttri Lab in the Department of Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University. My research interests are centered on how the brain makes decsions and how those decsions are executed via movement. 
I have previously trained with Dr. Betsy Murray at the National Institute of Mental Health studying cortical and subcortical contributions to learning, value and decsion making.
I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a degree in Neuroscience where I trained with Dr. Sandra Kuhlman studying finctional plasticity in the visual cortex.
